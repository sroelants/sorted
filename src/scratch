How would I visualize the partition step? Instead of a generator, simply use a for-loop?
Definitely seems easier to do this in a loop...

then, quicksort the left side and the right? So, simply:

function* quicksort(array, min, max) {
  partition... (should return an index as well.)
  yield* quicksort(less)
  yield* quicksort(greater)
}
